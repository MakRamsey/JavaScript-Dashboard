# JavaScript-Dashboard

Greetings,

Welcome to the JavaScript Dashboard repository! This project utilized JavaScript, D3 and Plotly to explore and generate an interactive dashboard for a belly button biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbial levels that colonize human navels.


**Repository Structure:**

- "index.html": Index html file leveraging static/js/app.js file for page generation

- "samples.json": JSON file representing the dataset locally, although a URL was accessed within code

- 'static': Directory containing 'js' which houses the main JavaScript code for the dashboard ('app.js')

Please note: The dashboard can be viewed via a GitHub pages at: https://makramsey.github.io/JavaScript-Dashboard/


Thanks!
